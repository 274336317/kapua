    # * Restarting a job with one Target and one Step *
    # *************************************************

  Scenario: Restarting Job With Valid "Command Execution" And Step Index=0 For The First Time
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new valid Command Execution step to the created job. Restart the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK

    Given I start the Kura Mock
    When Device "is" connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
