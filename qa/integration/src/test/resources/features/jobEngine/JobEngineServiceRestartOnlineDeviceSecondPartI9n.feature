Feature: JobEngineService restart job tests with online device - second part

  Scenario: Set environment variables
    Given System property "broker.ip" with value "localhost"
    And System property "commons.db.connection.host" with value "localhost"

  Scenario: Start event broker for all scenarios
    Given Start Event Broker

  Scenario: Start broker for all scenarios

    # * Restarting a job with one Target and one Step *
    # *************************************************

  Scenario: Restarting A Job with valid Configuration Put Step And Step Index=0 For The First Time
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new valid Configuration Put step to the created job. Restart the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK

    Given I start the Kura Mock
    When Device "is" connected
    And I wait 1 seconds
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService has property clock.ntp.retry.interval with value 5
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A new job target item
    And Search for step definition with the name "Configuration Put"
    And A regular step creator with the name "TestStep" and the following properties
